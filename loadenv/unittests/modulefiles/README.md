Modulefiles
-----------

This directory is based on the modulefiles directory used by SetEnvironment.

This directory contains a 'sample' of modulefiles for use in testing
LoadEnv.

Generally the modules just create envvars called `TEST_LOADENV_<MODULE>_<VER>`

We can use these both for unit testing and for the example application.
